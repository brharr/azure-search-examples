# Azure-Search-Examples

## Description

This repo is a companion to the Implementing a Cognitive Search Solution course that I authored for Cloud Academy and contains code sample relative to the topics that I discussed within the course.

All code is fully functional and has been Debugged and Stepped through and can be run as-is. All dependencies for the code base can be found in the language's specific package management section (i.e package.json, AzureSearchExamples_NET.csproj, etc.)

* C# = F5 Debug or Build and Execute the Command-Line file.
* NodeJS = Coming Soon

## Assumption

This code does assume that you already have an Azure SQL Server created with the AdventureWorks sample database
